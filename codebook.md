##General info

* '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
* Units are in standard gravity units.
* All values are between [-1,1]

 
##These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  

* tBodyAcc-XYZ
* tGravityAcc-XYZ
* tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
* tBodyGyro-XYZ
* tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
* tBodyAccMag
* tGravityAccMag
* tBodyAccJerkMag
* tBodyGyroMag
* tBodyGyroJerkMag
* fBodyAcc-XYZ
* fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
* fBodyGyro-XYZ
* fBodyAccMag
* fBodyAccJerkMag
* fBodyGyroMag
* fBodyGyroJerkMag

##The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

* mean(): Mean value
* std(): Standard deviation

##Id Fields
 * subject - The participant ID number. Between 1-30
 * activity - The activiety the subject is performing during that test.
 
##Activity labels
* Walking 
* Walking Upstairs
* Walking Downstairs
* Sitting
* Standing
* Laying
